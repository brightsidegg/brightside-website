            <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
              Brightside provides a software interface that allows users to view, organise, and analyse publicly 
              available digital-market information using third-party technology providers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
              The App is strictly a visual and informational interface. It does not operate an exchange, provide 
              financial advice, offer brokerage or investment services, or hold or transfer client funds.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
              Any interaction with external systems or technologies takes place directly between you and those 
              independent providers, and Brightside is not a counterparty to any such interaction.
            </p>

              Access to certain features of the App may require a subscription or one-time fee, which will be disclosed 
              clearly before any purchase.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
              All fees relate solely to software and interface access. Brightside does not charge or receive fees for 
              transactions or financial activity.

              third party directly.
